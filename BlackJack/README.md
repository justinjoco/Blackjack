<p>This is a Blackjack java program that I made based on elements of my Badjack program with actual Card, Deck, Hand, and Blackjack classes.</p>
Card.java and Deck.java are based on code found here: http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/javanotes4/c5/ex-5-5-answer.html. I added
some more class methods to these to fit my needs.
