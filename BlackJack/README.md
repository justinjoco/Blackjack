#My Blackjack Program

<p>This is a Blackjack java program that I made based on elements of my Badjack program with actual Card, Deck, Hand, and Blackjack classes.</p>
Card.java and Deck.java are based on code found here: http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/javanotes4/c5/ex-5-5-answer.html. I added
some more class methods to these to fit my needs.

### How to play
1. Enter total amount of money you have
2. Enter how many decks to shuffle
3. Enter how many times deck should be shuffled
4. Enter bet
5. Play Blackjack (follows normal rules)
6. Keep playing until user specifies or until there's no money left
